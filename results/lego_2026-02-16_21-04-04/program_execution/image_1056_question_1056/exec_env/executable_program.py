# These should be actual image objects, not strings.
# Here, we're assuming they are correctly initialized elsewhere in the environment.

# Let's define each option image and the target assembly as unique image variables,
# assuming they have been initialized properly in the environment.

# The correct format should ensure they are image objects, not strings.
# Option images
