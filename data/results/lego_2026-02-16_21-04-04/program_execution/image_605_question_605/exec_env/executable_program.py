# Since the error indicates 'current_state' is not defined, let's assume these images are directly accessible.

# Use the _determine_installation_point function to find the correct option (A, B, C, D, or E).

# Assuming the images are set in a way we can reference them as constants.
# In a practical scenario, these would be provided or fetched from a data source.

# Replace 'image_1', 'image_2', ... with the actual image references if they were provided.
