# PROGRAM STARTS HERE

# Use the API function to determine the correct order of steps given the current and target state images
# and the step images A, B, C, and D, which are represented by their respective indices in the options list.

# Define images for the current state, target state, and steps
# These should be assigned to the actual images provided in your environment
current_state_image = image1  # Placeholder for current state image
target_state_image = image2  # Placeholder for target state image
step_images = [image3, image4, image5, image6]  # Placeholders for step images A, B, C, D

# Since the problem involves ordering, we will assume a function or mechanism to determine the sequence.
# Since _identify_incorrect_step() is not the correct function for ordering, let's use a hypothetical function
# _determine_step_order() which is assumed to exist for this purpose:

# Use the API to determine the correct order of steps
ordered_steps = _determine_installation_point(current_state_image, target_state_image, step_images)

# Store the order as a sequence of letters corresponding to the steps
final_result = ordered_steps
