# PROGRAM STARTS HERE

# The task is to determine which option correctly shows the state of the LEGO assembly after adding the next piece.
# We will use the API function _determine_installation_point to analyze the assembly progression.

# The given images are indexed by their description in the question. 
# Since we only have a variable named "image", we'll assume it's possible to reference parts of this or it's structured to represent the needed images.
# Given that, let's assume the images are part of a list or similar structure initialized elsewhere.

# Use the API function to determine the correct option.
# We need to replace the placeholders like 'image1', 'image2', etc., with the correct image references.

# Assuming the correct image references are available in the context as follows:
current_state = image[0]  # This should be the first image (current assembly state)
piece_to_install = image[1]  # This should be the second image (next piece to be added)
target_state = image[2]  # This should be the third image (target final state)

# Options for the assembly state after adding the piece
options = [image[3], image[4], image[5], image[6], image[7]]  # These should correspond to options A, B, C, D, E

# Determine the correct assembly point using the API function
correct_option = _determine_installation_point(current_state, piece_to_install, target_state, options)

# Store the result in final_result as instructed
final_result = correct_option
