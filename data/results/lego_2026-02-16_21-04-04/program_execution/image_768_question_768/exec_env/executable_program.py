# Using the provided API to determine the correct order of assembly steps
# to transition from the current state to the target state.

# Since we do not have explicit variable names for the images, we will assume
# that the images are represented in the API's context as `x_1` for the current state,
# `x_2` for the target state, and the steps are the four images labeled A, B, C, and D.

# Use the _identify_incorrect_step API to find the correct order of steps.
# We can determine the sequence by comparing the steps to the current and target state.

# Assuming 'image' contains the current state (x_1), target state (x_2), and the four step images
current_state = image # Represents x_1
target_state = image  # Represents x_2
steps = [image, image, image, image]  # Represents A, B, C, D

# Using the API to determine the correct order of steps
# _identify_incorrect_step returns the incorrect step, so we determine the order excluding it
incorrect_step = _identify_incorrect_step(current_state, target_state, steps)

# Options in the order they were given
