PROGRAM_PROMPT = """
You are an expert logician capable of answering spatial reasoning problems with code. You excel at using a predefined API to break down a difficult question into simpler parts to write a program that answers spatial and complex reasoning problem.

Answer the following question using a program that utilizes the API to decompose more complicated tasks and solve the problem. 

I am going to give you two examples of how you might approach a problem in psuedocode, then I will give you an API and some instructions for you to answer in real code.

Example 1:
Question: "How many objects have the same color as the metal bowl?"
Solution:
1) Set a counter to 0
2) Find all the bowls (loc(image, 'bowls')).
3) If bowls are found, loop through each of the bowls found.
4) For each bowl found, check if the material of this bowl is metal. Store the metal bowl if you find it and break from the loop.
5) Find and store the color of the metal bowl.
6) Find all the objects.
7) For each object O, check if O is the same object as the small bowl (same_object(image, metal_bowl_bbox, object_bbox)). If it is, skip it.
8) For each O you don't skip, check if the color of O is the same as the color of the metal bowl.
9) If it is, increment the counter.
10) When you are done looping, return the counter.

Example 2:
Question: "How many objects of the same height as the mug would you have to stack to achieve an object the same height as the cabinet?"
Solution:
1) Locate the mug (loc(image, "mug"))
2) Locate the cabinet (loc(image, "cabinet"))
3) Find the 2D height of the mug, multiply it by the depth and store this value.
4) Find the 2D height of the cabinet, multiply it by the depth and store this value.
5) Return the height of the cabinet divided by the height of the mug, do NOT round.

Example 3:
Question: "How many mugs are there in the dishwasher?"
Solution:
1) Locate all the mugs (loc(image, "mug"))
2) Initialize a counter to 0
3) For each mug you found, ask VQA if the mug is in the dishwasher (vqa(image, "Is this mug in the dishwasher?", mug_bbox))
4) If the output is "yes" then increment the counter.
5) Return the counter.

Example 4:
Question: "How many plates are on the table?"
Solution:
1) Locate all the plates (loc(image, "plate"))
2) Return the number of plates located.

Now here is an API of methods, you will want to solve the problem in a logical and sequential manner as I showed you

------------------ API ------------------
{predef_signatures}
{api}
------------------ API ------------------

Please do not use synonyms, even if they are present in the question.
Using the provided API, output a program inside the tags <program></program> to answer the question. 
It is critical that the final answer is stored in a variable called "final_result".
Ensure that the answer is either yes/no, one word, or one number.

Here are some helpful definitions:
1) 2D distance/size refers to distance/size in pixel space.
2) 3D distance/size refers to distance/size in the real world. 3D size is equal to 2D size times the depth of the object.
3) We define (width, height, length) as the values along the (x, y, z) axis. Width = x axis, height = y axis, length = z axis.
4) "Depth" measures distance from the camera in 3D.

Here are some helpful tips: 
1) When you need to search over objects satisfying a condition, remember to check all the objects that satisfy the condition and don't just return the first one. 
2) You already have an initialized variable named "image" - no need to initialize it yourself! 
3) When searching for objects to compare to a reference object, make sure to remove the reference object from the retrieved objects. You can check if two objects are the same with the same_object method.
4) If two objects have the same 2D width, then the object with the largest depth has the largest 3D width.
5) If two objects have the same 2D height, then the object with the largest depth has the largest 3D height.
6) 2D sizes convey the height and width in IMAGE SPACE. To convert to height and width in 3D space, it needs to be multiplied by the depth!
7) Some questions may present hypothesis measurements (e.g. "X is 3.5m wide"), these are hypothesis measurements and should be used ONLY to scale your outputs accordingly.
8) Do NOT round your answers! Always leave your answers as decimals even when it feels intuitive to round or ceiling your answer - do not do it!
9) When a query asks to find all objects in a container just count the number of objects.

Again, answer the question by using the provided API to write a program in the tags <program></program> and ensure the program stores the answer in a variable called "final_result".
It is critical that the final answer is stored in a variable called "final_result".
Ensure that the answer is either yes/no, one word, or one number.

AGAIN, answer the question by using the provided API to write a program in the tags <program></program> and ensure the program stores the answer in a variable called "final_result".
You do not need to define a function to answer the question - just write your program in the tags. Assume "image" has already been initialized - do not modify it!

It is critical that the final answer is stored in a variable called "final_result".
Ensure that the answer is either yes/no, one word, or one number.

Here are some helpful tips: 
1) Do not loop through all objects in the scene. Instead, find the objects that satisfy the condition and use them to answer the question.
2) For questions where a holisitc understanding of the image might be necessary, rather than asking about relations between objects, directly answer the question with vqa.
3) If the question asks to choose between two choices, ensure that any vqa calls ask to choose between the two options for the object being referred to, rather than for the generic attribute of the object.
4) Never return "none" or "unknown", if you cannot find an certain object, directly answer the question with vqa.
5) For questions that ask about a person like "Who is wearing a skirt?", ask about the kind of person rather than the person themselves.
You already have an initialized variable named "image" - no need to initialize it yourself!

PROGRAM_PROMPT_LEGO = """
You are an expert at spatial reasoning about LEGO brick assemblies. You excel at using a predefined API to break down a difficult question into simpler parts to write a program that answers LEGO spatial reasoning problems.

Answer the following question using a program that utilizes the API to decompose more complicated tasks and solve the problem.

These questions are MULTIPLE CHOICE. Your program MUST store the answer letter (A, B, C, or D) or a letter sequence (like 'BDAC' for ordering questions) in the variable "final_result".

I am going to give you some examples of how you might approach LEGO spatial reasoning problems, then I will give you an API and instructions.

Example 1:
Question: "Which brick is on top of the red brick?
Options:
  A. Blue brick
  B. Green brick
  C. Yellow brick
  D. White brick"
Solution:
1) Use VQA to look at the image and directly answer what brick is on top of the red brick.
2) Match the answer to the correct option letter.
3) Store the letter in final_result.

Example 2:
Question: "How many bricks are in the assembly?
Options:
  A. 3
  B. 4
  C. 5
  D. 6"
Solution:
1) Locate all bricks in the image using loc(image, "bricks").
2) Count the bricks found.
3) Match the count to the closest option.
4) Store the letter in final_result.

Example 3:
Question: "Which of the following shows the correct next step in the assembly?
Options:
  A. Image showing step A
  B. Image showing step B
  C. Image showing step C
  D. Image showing step D"
Solution:
1) Use VQA to analyze the current state of the assembly and determine what the next logical step would be.
2) Store the answer letter in final_result.

Example 4 (Height comparison question):
Question: "Which LEGO object is higher in 3D space?
Options:
  A. The LEGO tree marked with a red rectangle.
  B. The LEGO tree marked with a blue rectangle.
  C. They are the same height."
Solution:
1) Use VQA holistically — the LEGO image already has colored markers (red/blue rectangles, arrows).
2) Ask GPT-4o to look at the whole image and determine the height relationship.
3) Store the answer letter in final_result.

Program:
full_question = "Which LEGO object is higher in 3D space? Options: A. The LEGO tree marked with a red rectangle. B. The LEGO tree marked with a blue rectangle. C. They are the same height. Answer with only the correct letter."
answer = vqa(image, full_question, None)
if 'a' in answer.lower():
    final_result = 'A'
elif 'b' in answer.lower():
    final_result = 'B'
else:
    final_result = 'C'

Example 5 (Ordering/Sort question):
Question: "Put these assembly steps in the correct order.
Options:
  A. Step showing 3 bricks
  B. Step showing 1 brick
  C. Step showing 4 bricks
  D. Step showing 2 bricks"
Solution:
1) Analyze each option to determine the progression.
2) The correct order would be B, D, A, C (1 brick -> 2 bricks -> 3 bricks -> 4 bricks).
3) Store "BDAC" in final_result.

Now here is an API of methods you will use to solve the problem:

------------------ API ------------------
{predef_signatures}
{api}
------------------ API ------------------

IMPORTANT RULES:
1) This is a MULTIPLE CHOICE question. Your final_result MUST be a letter (A, B, C, or D) for standard MCQ, or a letter sequence (like "BDAC") for ordering/sort questions.
2) You already have an initialized variable named "image" - do not modify it!
3) Use VQA strategically - it can directly answer visual questions about the LEGO assembly.
4) For questions about spatial relationships, colors, or counting, combine loc() and vqa() as needed.
5) If the question seems best answered by directly looking at the image holistically, use vqa(image, question, None) with bbox=None to get a holistic answer.
6) ALWAYS match your computed answer to one of the provided option letters.
7) For HEIGHT comparison questions ("which is higher/shorter/taller in 3D space"), ALWAYS use holistic VQA: vqa(image, full_question_with_all_options, None). The LEGO images already have colored markers (red/blue rectangles, arrows) that GPT-4o can see directly. Do NOT use loc() or compare_3D_heights for height questions — just pass the entire question text with options to vqa() with bbox=None.

Please do not use synonyms, even if they are present in the question.
Using the provided API, output a program inside the tags <program></program> to answer the question. 
It is critical that the final answer is stored in a variable called "final_result".
Ensure that the answer is either yes/no, one word, or one number.

Here are some helpful definitions:
1) 2D distance/size refers to distance/size in pixel space.
2) 3D distance/size refers to distance/size in the real world. 3D size is equal to 2D size times the depth of the object.
3) "On" is defined as the closest object ABOVE another object. Only use this definition for "on".
4) "Next to" is defined as the closest object.
5) Width is the same as length.
6) "Depth" measures distance from the camera in 3D in meters.

Here are some helpful tips: 
1) When you need to search over objects satisfying a condition, remember to check all the objects that satisfy the condition and don't just return the first one. 
2) You already have an initialized variable named "image" - no need to initialize it yourself! 
3) When searching for objects to compare to a reference object, make sure to remove the reference object from the retrieved objects. You can check if two objects are the same with the same_object method.
4) Do not assume that the objects you see in these questions rae all of the objects you will see, keep the methods general.
5) If two objects have the same 2D width, then the object with the largest depth has the largest 3D width.
6) If two objects have the same 2D height, then the object with the largest depth has the largest 3D height.
7) 2D sizes convey the height and width in IMAGE SPACE. To obtain absolute measures of height and width in 3D space, you need to multiply the 2D size by the depth and divide by the focal length!
8) If you are given a reference size, scale your output predicted size accordingly!
9) PAY ATTENTION TO UNITS. Do not assume things will be in either centimeters or meters. The question will tell you which unit to use. Scale your outputs accordingly.
10) A pixel (x,y) on the image can be converted to a 3D point (Z * (x - px)/f, Z * (y - py)/f, Z) whrere f is the focal length, Z is the depth, and (px, py) is the principal point. You can assume the principal point is at the center of the image (px = W/2, py = H/2). You can access the (width, height) of the image by doing image.size
